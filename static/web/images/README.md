# Logo Directory

Place your logo file here as `logo.png`

## Supported Formats
- PNG (recommended)
- SVG
- JPG/JPEG

## File Name
The template expects: `logo.png`

If you use a different name or format, update the template at:
`templates/web/index.html` (line ~358)

## Image Size Recommendations
- Height: 32px (will be auto-scaled)
- Format: PNG with transparency (for best results)
- File size: Keep under 100KB for fast loading

## After Adding Logo
1. Place your logo file here as `logo.png`
2. Run: `python3 manage.py collectstatic` (if in production)
3. Refresh the page - logo should appear!

If the logo doesn't load, the text "SAT Prep Reading" will still display.

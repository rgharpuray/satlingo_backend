    <p>Premium features may require a paid subscription. Subscription terms, pricing, renewal, and cancellation are described at the point of purchase (e.g., in-app or on the website). Refunds are governed by the applicable platform (e.g., Apple App Store or Google Play) or our payment processor’s policies where relevant.</p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>Keuvi and its content (including text, graphics, and software) are owned by Argos Ventures LLC or its licensors. You receive a limited, non-exclusive right to use the Service in accordance with these Terms. You do not acquire any ownership or license beyond that.</p>

    <h2>6. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided “as is.” We do not guarantee that it will improve SAT scores or be error-free. We disclaim all warranties to the fullest extent permitted by law.</p>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Argos Ventures LLC and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the Service. Our total liability for any claims related to the Service shall not exceed the amount you paid us in the twelve months before the claim.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will post the revised Terms on this page and update the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="muted">Last updated: January 2026</p>

    <p>Argos Ventures LLC (“we,” “us,” “our”) operates Keuvi, an SAT preparation service. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website, mobile apps, and related services (the “Service”).</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Account and identity:</strong> Email, name (if provided), and identifiers from sign-in providers (e.g., Google, Apple) when you create or use an account.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage and progress:</strong> Answers, scores, and progress (e.g., lessons and passages completed) so we can run the Service and show you your results and history.</li>
        <li><strong>Device and technical data:</strong> IP address, device type, browser or app version, and similar technical data that we or our vendors use for security, analytics, and operations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect to: provide and improve the Service; personalize content and practice; process subscriptions and payments; send important service-related messages; detect and prevent abuse; and comply with law. We may use analytics and error-reporting tools (e.g., PostHog, Sentry) to understand usage and fix issues; these may receive usage data and technical identifiers.</p>

    <h2>3. Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share data with: (a) service providers that help us run the Service (e.g., hosting, payments, analytics), under contractual obligations to protect your data; (b) authorities when required by law or to protect rights and safety; (c) a successor if we merge or sell our business.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Retention and Security</h2>
    <p>We retain your account and progress data for as long as your account exists and as needed for the purposes in this policy. We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data; no system is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Rights</h2>
    <p>You can update account details in the Service. You may request access, correction, or deletion of your personal data by contacting us at <a href="mailto:admin@argosventures.pro">admin@argosventures.pro</a>. You may also delete your account through the in-app or account management options we provide. Where applicable (e.g., in the EEA or UK), you may have additional rights such as objecting to or restricting certain processing.</p>

    <h2>6. Children</h2>
    <p>The Service is intended for users at least 13 years old. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have done so, please contact us and we will take steps to delete it.</p>

    <h2>7. International Transfers</h2>
    <p>Our systems may be located in the United States or elsewhere. If you use the Service from outside the U.S., your data may be transferred to and processed in those locations. We take steps to protect your information in line with this policy.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the revised policy on this page and update the “Last updated” date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>For privacy-related questions or requests, contact us at <a href="mailto:admin@argosventures.pro">admin@argosventures.pro</a> or via our <a href="/support/">Support</a> page.</p>
